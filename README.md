# Bijectivity of exponential and polynomial maps

## Installation

from folder
```
make install
```

To download and install the latest development version on a system where Sage
was built from source or installed from official packages, run

    sage -pip install git+https://github.com/MarcusAichmayr/bijectivity_exponential_maps.git

or

    sage -pip install --user git+https://github.com/MarcusAichmayr/bijectivity_exponential_maps.git

The optional --user flag causes the package to be installed in your .sage directory instead of the Sage installation tree.


To load the module `bijectivity_exponential_maps`, run
```
from bijectivity_exponential_maps import *
```
